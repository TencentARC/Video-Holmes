## üîé Introduction

Video-Holmes is <b>a benchmark designed to evaluate the complex video reasoning capabilities of MLLMs</b>. 

Video-Holmes consists of 1,837 questions derived from 270 manually annotated <b>suspense short films</b> (ranging from 1 to 5 minutes), which spans <b>seven carefully designed tasks</b>. Each task is constructed by first identifying key events and causal relationships within films, and then designing questions that require models to <b>actively locate and connect multiple relevant visual clues scattered across different video segments</b>.

‚≠ê Key Aspects of Video-Holmes:

<ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 20px;">
<li><b>One-Click Evaluation:</b> Videos, questions, and evaluation codes are packaged on GitHub and <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/TencentARC/Video-Holmes" target="_blank">Huggingface</a>.</li>
<li><b>High Reasoning Demand:</b> Significant performance gap between reasoning models and non-reasoning models.</li>
<li><b>Reasoning Process Analysis:</b> Clearly visualizes the reasons behind correct and incorrect model responses.</li>
</ul>

We aim that Video-Holmes can serve as a <i>"Holmes-test"</i> for multimodal reasoning, motivating models to reason more like humans and emphasizing the ongoing challenges in this field. Please visit our [homepage](https://video-holmes.github.io/Page.github.io/) for more details!

> Welcome to contact us at Howe4884@outlook.com to upload your model to the leaderboard.


## üöÄ Quick Start

To download Video-Holmes, you can run the following commands:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/TencentARC/Video-Holmes.git
cd Video-Holmes
pip install huggingface_hub
python download.py --hf_token YOUR_HUGGINGFACE_ACCESS_TOKEN
unzip Benchmark/videos.zip -d Benchmark/
unzip Benchmark/annotations.zip -d Benchmark/
```

We provide all-in-one evaluation codes for baseline models:
```shell
python evaluate.py --model_name YOUR_MODEL_NAME --model_path YOUR_MODEL_PATH (optional)
```

Supported Model List:

| QwenVL | QwenVL-RL | InternVL | Gemini |
|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| Qwen2.5-VL-7B  | VideoChat-R1  | InternVL2.5-8B | gemini-2.0-flash |
| Qwen2.5-VL-32B | Video-R1  | InternVL3-8B | gemini-2.0-pro-exp | 

You can also customize your model by specifying the `--model_path` argument, or by implementing the following functions: `prepare_your_model` (line 388) and `generate_your_model` (line 439).

<summary><b>üßê Reasoning Process Analysis</b></summary>
  
You first need to apply a [DeepSeek API key](https://platform.deepseek.com/api_keys) and then you can run the following commands to analyze the reasoning process of your models:

```shell
python evaluate_reasoning.py --model_name YOUR_MODEL_NAME --api_key YOUR_API_KEY
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>ü™Ñ Generate Your Holmes-Test</b></summary>
  
To generate questions for your videos with annotations, you can run the following commands:

```shell
cd Pipeline
python generate_questions.py --api_key YOUR_API_KEY
```

> Note: You can down load the video on YouTube according to the `VIDEO_ID` by `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID`

## üõ†Ô∏è Construction Pipeline

We select 270 high-quality suspense short films for human annotation. Next, we design 7 challenging tasks and employ DeepSeek to generate questions. Finally, we evaluate SOTA MLLMs and use DeepSeek to analyze their responses (optional).

## üóùÔ∏è Question Types

Existing benchmarks primarily involve clue-given questions, where models depend on explicitly provided clues to derive answers. In contrast, Video-Holmes adopts an active seeking paradigm, requiring models to actively locate and connect multiple relevant visual clues scattered across different video segments.
